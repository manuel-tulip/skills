# Investigation entry

Use this full format for substantive implementation, design, debugging, or an explicit detailed-diary request. Begin each step with 1–2 prose paragraphs. The prompt is verbatim once, then referenced. Preserve exact failures, not invented or reconstructed diagnostics.

```markdown
## Step N: Descriptive title

One or two short paragraphs explaining intent, change and outcome.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** "Actual authored request" (or: see Step N)
**Assistant interpretation:** What is being requested.
**Inferred user intent:** Intended outcome and reason.
**Commit (code):** hash — "message" (when available)

### What I did
- Concrete files, symbols and commands.

### Why
- Rationale and considered alternatives.

### What worked
- Evidence-backed outcomes.

### What didn't work
- Exact command, diagnostic, scope and recovery; or no failures observed.

### What I learned
- Corrected assumptions and constraints.

### What was tricky to build
- Underlying cause, symptoms and exact solution, including ordering/lifetime boundaries.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Review-critical correctness, concurrency, security or performance questions.

### What should be done in the future
- Follow-ups implied by this step; N/A if none.

### Code review instructions
- Starting files/symbols and validation commands.

### Technical details
- Concrete contracts, snippets, limits and references.

Do not add compatibility shims unless required. Record behavior changes and update tests/docs. A passing test alone does not prove all user requirements are satisfied.
